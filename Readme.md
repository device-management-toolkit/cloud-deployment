## Get Started

### There are multiple options to quickly deploy the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit:

<br>

### Local using Docker
The quickest and easiest option is to set up a local stack using Docker*, view our [Getting Started Guide](https://open-amt-cloud-toolkit.github.io/docs/1.4/Docker/overview/) for How-To steps and examples.

<br>

### Cloud using Azure
For more experienced users, deploy the stack on Azure using the 'Deploy to Azure' button below. Note: This requires MPS, RPS, and Sample Web UI images to be built and accessible in a Container Image Registry such as Azure Container Registry (ACR), Docker Hub, or other options.

Optionally, deploy from AzureCLI using the following commands:

``` bash
az group create --name openamt --location eastus
az deployment group create --resource-group openamt --template-file azureDeploy.json
```
